This web extension adds a context menu item you can select
when right-clicking an <img> element on a web page.

It then will rotate the image in steps of +90 degrees right or -90 degrees left.

Beware that this rotation will only take place when viewing the
web page in the browser. When you download the image it will still be
in the original orientation!

This Chrome and Firefox extension is available on:
